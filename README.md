# trading-cockpit-frontend
Frontend of the Trading Cockpit application.

## Features
The frontend provides you with views for creation, editing, display and overview of the following business objects.

- Price Alerts
- Instruments
- Lists
- Scans

Some business objects have additional views. It's functions are described in the according sections.

### Price Alerts
A price alert notifies you if the price of a stock reaches a certain threshold. There are two types of alerts. One type informs you if a price is equal or higher than your defined price. The other type informs you if the price is equal of lower than your defined price.

The Feed view cyclically queries all price alerts that have been triggered but not yet confirmed. You can confirm each price alert in the feed. It vanishes from the feed after confirmation.

### Instruments
Here you can manage all instruments that you later want to use for the stock screener or price alert functionality.

There is an additional function called instrument health check. In this view you can choose an Instrument and a starting date for the health check. 
The application then checks the price and volume behavior of the instrument and displays a protocol allowing you to gauge the health of the instrument.

### Lists
Lists allow you to organize sets of instruments. The list feature allows you for example to reproduce ETFs or stock indexes. Lists are used by the scan functionality to scan and screen all instruments of multiple lists.

The list overview provides a functionality to generate Excel files. The file contains the instrument symbol as well as the most recent price of all instruments of the selected list.

### Scans
Scans consist of multiple lists that contain instruments. Scans are executed from the scan overview. The scan 'status' and 'percent completed' attributes inform you about the progress of the scan. 
The scanner detects instruments for which the data retrieval failed. The number of instruments for which the scan failed is being displayed in the overview.
You can restart a scan and only load those instruments for which the scan process failed the last time.

Once a scan has been finished you can view the results in the scan result view. The table shows instruments with their indicator values. You can sort the list by multiple indicators by clicking on the 'sort' button.
Each table row provides a button that allows you to open a chart for the given instrument. Indicator columns can be set to visible or invisible according to your needs.

There is also a function to compare a list of instruments. You can choose instruments by clicking on the scale button and then selecting instruments from the list popup. This helps you to directly compare only those instruments you are interested in.

The scan result view offers nine templates.

- All (Default template, loads all scanned instruments)
- Minervini Trend Template (Instruments in a Stage 2 uptrend)
- Volatility Contraction - 10 Days (Instruments that show narrow price action and below average volume during the last 10 trading days)
- Breakout Candidates (Instruments consolidating near their 52 week highs on low volatility and below average volume)
- Up on Volume (Instruments gaining more than 10% on at least 25% increased volume during the last 5 trading days)
- Down on Volume (Instruments losing more that 10% on at least 25% increased volume during the last 5 trading days)
- Near 52-week High (Instruments trading within 5% of their 52-week high)
- Near 52-week Low (Instruments trading within 5% of their 52-week low)
- RS since Date (All scanned instruments, calculates RS number since the given date)

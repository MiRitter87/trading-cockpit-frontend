Frontend of the Trading Cockpit application

## Features
The frontend provides you with views for creation, editing, display and overview of the following features.

- Price Alerts
- Instruments
- Lists

### Price Alerts
A price alert notifies you if the price of a stock reaches a certain threshold. There are two types of alerts. One alert informs you if a price is equal or higher than your defined price. The other type informs you if the price is equal of lower your defined price.

### Instruments
Here you can manage all instruments that you later want to use for the stock screener functionality.

### Lists
Lists allow you to organize sets of instruments. The list feature allows you for example to reproduce ETFs or stock indexes. Lists are later used by the Scan functionality to scan and screen all stocks of a given list.

## Technology
